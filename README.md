Uber Ride Analysis
This project provides a detailed analysis of an Uber ride dataset to identify patterns and trends in ride bookings. By exploring the data, we gain insights into user behavior, trip purposes, and ride frequency across various dimensions such as time and distance.

Dataset Overview
The dataset contains details about Uber rides, including:

START_DATE: Start time of the trip.
END_DATE: End time of the trip.
CATEGORY: Trip category (e.g., Business or Personal).
START: Starting location of the trip.
STOP: Ending location of the trip.
MILES: Distance traveled during the trip.
PURPOSE: Purpose of the trip (e.g., Meeting, Errand/Supplies, etc.).
Analysis Goals

We aim to answer the following questions:

Which trip category (Business or Personal) is most popular?
What is the most common purpose for booking rides?
At what time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) are rides most frequently booked?
In which month are rides booked most often?
On which day of the week are rides booked most frequently?
How many miles do people typically travel when booking an Uber ride?




Tools and Techniques


Python Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation.
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
datetime for time-based analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualizations.
Analysis Insights
Category Popularity: Determine whether Business or Personal rides are booked more frequently.
Purpose Trends: Analyze the most common purposes for ride bookings.
Time of Day Patterns: Identify when users prefer to book rides (morning, afternoon, evening, or night).
Monthly and Weekly Trends: Explore seasonal and weekly patterns in ride bookings.
Distance Insights: Calculate average and total miles traveled by Uber users.
Visualizations


The project includes:

Bar charts for categorical analysis (e.g., category, purpose).
Line charts for monthly and weekly trends.
Pie charts to visualize proportions of ride purposes.
Histograms to analyze trip distances.
